        <h2 id="C1">What we do</h2>
        <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that are diagnosed with a disability.<br><br>
            After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.<br><br>
            With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children, with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after by the Directors and friends.<br><br>
            Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided over 150 grants covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing and other assistance to these very special kids.<br><br>
            We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts and through various yearly fund raising activities.These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each September and a Brisbane Businessmanâ€™s lunch held each November.<br><br>
            Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May 2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax deductible.<br><br>

        <h3>Be a Volunteer</h3>
        <p>Volunteering is a great way to meet new people and strengthen existing relationships as you are committing to a shared activity together.<br><br>
            Volunteering also enhances your ties to the community and broadens your support network, exposing you to people with common interests, neighborhood resources and occasionally fun activities.<br><br>
            Another value gained by being volunteer is increasing your social and relationship skills. While some of us are naturally outgoing and talkative people, some are shyer and find it harder meeting new people. By volunteering, it is giving you the opportunity to practice and develop your social skills. If you are meeting and working regularly with a group of people with similar interests to yourself, it is easier to become comfortable and use the momentum outside of your volunteering group.<br><br>
            A further advantage of volunteering is expanding your work experience. While gaining a paid job from volunteering is not always likely, the experience you gain will really help when it comes to completing job applications and doing interviews.<br><br>
